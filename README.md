# Overview

In the tutorial, we build a CRUD REST API from scratch using .NET 6.
As you would expect, the backend system supports Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting breakfasts.

# Chapter Notes

## Chapter One

Setting up the projects. Refer commands.txt
Contracts project models our API. If it is separately in a classlib, can be published as Nuget Package.
Web API holds our CRUD API and business logic.

Docs: Holds our API definition
Requests: Holds our API request definitions for testing

## Chapter Two

Created Models in Contracts project
Cleaned up Program.cs

## Chapter Three

API definition
Created CRUD endpoints

## Chapter Four

Models and converting between them

Motivation behind internal service models - 
We create a contracts folder to represent the CONTRACT that we have with the client. We do not modify this.
We map the data from the contract to an internal service model and inside the application, we only speak the language of this internal service model. The contracts model is ONLY for consistency with the client.

In our CreateBreakfast controller method, we get the breakfast request, convert it to the internal service model (breakfast) and then after saving in the database, we convert it to breakfastResponse (DTO) and send it back to the client.

NEW THING WE DID - Instead of returning Ok() from IActionResult, we return CreatedAtAction. This returns 201, and accepts 3 parameters:
1. The action that the client can use to retrieve the resource
2. Then because the resource needs an ID, we pass an object that contains the newly created item ID
3. The response content

Implemented CRUD operations in controller and service


## Chapter Five

Global error handling
